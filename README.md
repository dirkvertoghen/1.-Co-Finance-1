      solution
      sales : 6,8
      Cost of sales $m  : 4,34
      
      AR turnover months : 2  (  Accountable receivable AR)
      AP turnover,months : 1  ( Accountable payables AP ) 
      Cash cycle months  : 3 
      Inventory tunrvoer, months : = 2 - 1 + 3 = 2
      
      Average inventory, $m : cost of sales * inventory turnover / 12 =  4,34 * 2 / 12 = 0,72333 mln
      Average AR $m : Sales/12 * AR turnover, months = 6,8/ 12 * 2                      = 1,13 mln
      Average AP $M                                                                     = 0,22 mln
      
      Total current assets  : Average inventory + average ar                           = 1,85667
      current ratio                                                                     = 1,4
      Current liabilities                                                              = 1,32619
      
      
      Bank overdraft    : Average AP - Current liabilites = 0,22 - 1,32619               = 1,10619
      
      Net working capital = assets - liabilites  =    1,85667 - 1,32619                  = 0,530476

B. Old Style Co. has received a discount offer from a supplier of a raw material. Old Style Co. currently uses the economic order quantity model to determine the reorder quantity for this item of material, but the supplier has offered a price discount of 1.5% off the normal purchase price for regular orders of 67,000 units or more.
  
The following information is relevant 
  
Current purchase price per unit of material: $4.50 
  
Monthly demand: 74,000 units 
  
Ordering cost: $70 
  
Current annual holding cost: $0.4 per unit per year 
  
The company estimates that if it switches to buying in quantities of 67,000 units or more, there would be a significant effect on holding costs, which would increase to $1 per unit per year.
  
Required 
  
(i) Calculate the total annual cost of inventory for this item of raw material if the order quantity is the economic order quantity
  
(ii) Calculate whether the offer of a bulk purchase discount from the supplier should be accepted, if the aim of management is to minimise inventory costs.
